# Bash_It

Replace this text with a brief introduction to the problem space.

## The Varied Learning Team 

* **Kailey Stauble** - The bug safari extraordinaire. Write the majority of Phase 1 report and has confirm phase 1 changes made to Github.  
* **Ceasar Salas** - The code crunching garden gnome. Moved Phase 1 report from Google Doc to markdown file format on Github and made relvent changes to main ReadMe.

## User-Centered Design Artifacts

* [Personas and Scenarios](personas-scenarios.md)
* [Wireframes](#)
* [Prototype](#)

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
* **Executive summary methods** (Remove me)  
We used two methods to aquire data on our problem.  
* Online survey of Bash and command line users (n=25) to get qualitative data on experiences.
* Study of documentation was used to understand the relevent content and current solutions to the problem.<br>  
* **data gathered** (Remove me)  
The data that was aquired in summary:
* There is formal evalution of the documentation study. 
  * Hard to read
  * Not visually appealing 
* Survey responses:
  * 80% have some or large amounts of existing knowledge on Bash
  * 76% agreed that they would like to learn more about Bash
  * 88% would like to know how write Bash scripts
  * 40% search blindly on the internet for Bash solutions
  * Only 32% have go-to websites they visit for Bash solutions
  * 91.7% noted that they prefer [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) for information on Bash<br>
* **and most important outcomes** (Remove me)  
From the data points above, we have found that a large majority would make use of a new method or website to learn Bash concepts. Responders appear to have a hard time with Bash and would be widely receptive to more intuitive process of learning Bash and troubleshooting it.
