# Bash_It

The problem space that our group is working on is varied learning, specifically when it comes to learning to program, such as learning Linux Bash. When learning Bash, there is a lot of new information to learn which can be intimidating to new users. There are a few ways to learn commands such as man pages and looking for help on the internet, but there is no platform that contains thorough explanations, videos, examples, and more that fully explain to users how to use commands and make learning easier. This is the problem we wish to address in our project. 

## The Varied Learning Team 

* **Kailey Stauble** - The bug safari extraordinaire. Wrote the majority of Phase 1 report and confirmed phase 1 changes made to Github. Assisted with the wireframes and prototype. Wrote explanations for wireframes as well as protocol tasks and questions for phase 3. Assisted in writing the protocol. 
* [Link to Journals](https://usabilityengineering.github.io/ux-portfolio-kkstauble/)
* 
* **Ceasar Salas** - The code crunching garden gnome. Moved Phase 1 report from Google Doc to markdown file format on Github and made relevant changes to main ReadMe.

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

We used two methods to aquire data on our problem.  
* Online survey of Bash and command line users (n=25) to get qualitative data on experiences.
* Study of documentation was used to understand the relevent content and current solutions to the problem.<br>  

The data that was aquired in summary:
* There is formal evalution of the documentation study. 
  * Hard to read
  * Not visually appealing 
* Survey responses:
  * 80% have some or large amounts of existing knowledge on Bash
  * 76% agreed that they would like to learn more about Bash
  * 88% would like to know how write Bash scripts
  * 40% search blindly on the internet for Bash solutions
  * Only 32% have go-to websites they visit for Bash solutions
  * 91.7% noted that they prefer [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) for information on Bash<br>

From the data points above, we have found that a large majority would make use of a new method or website to learn Bash concepts. Responders appear to have a hard time with Bash and would be widely receptive to more intuitive process of learning Bash and troubleshooting it.

## Phase 2: User-Centered Design

We have created and revised a collection of wireframes that can serve as a first draft of our design. The overall source of inspiration for the wireframes is a combination of simplicity, learnability, and relatable contemporary design. Simplicity and Learnibllty come in the forms of trying to have things divided and spaced so that it is easy to differentiate between categories while feeling intuitive to the user. For our more contemporary features, we used the websites: Codecademy.com, StackOverflow.com, and CPlusPlus.com as our references.

## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

Our [Bash_It Evaluation Protocol](phase3/Assets/Bash_It-Usability-Protocol.pdf "Bash_It Evaluation Protocol") follows the standard introduction, background, tasks, wrap-up format. 
The protocol should be used in conjunction with the linked [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FIqq6j3p5KgUfBvEwHWqkdQP7pWZI4gLfAT9lYCWlLQ/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for detailed note taking. 
  
Evaluation Protocol by the numbers:
* There are **4 background** questions
* There are **4 tasks** to complete 
   * Each task has **3 to 5** objectives to complete
   * Each task is **followed by a satisfaction** question concerning the task's difficulty
* There are **7 wrap up** questions to review the protocol
* The usability test should **take 30 to 45 minutes**
  
Within this report are all concerning links as well as a description of why we have each question or task. 
The Usability test should make use of the [Adobe XD Wireframe Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c58e83a1-0a07-43b8-a67d-16913158bbbc-90dd/) for use by the participant in their completion of their tasks.
