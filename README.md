# Bash_It

The problem space that our group is working on is varied learning, specifically when it comes to learning to program, such as learning Linux Bash. When learning Bash, there is a lot of new information to learn which can be intimidating to new users. There are a few ways to learn commands such as man pages and looking for help on the internet, but there is no platform that contains thorough explanations, videos, examples, and more that fully explain to users how to use commands and make learning easier. This is the problem we wish to address in our project. 

## The Varied Learning Team 

* **Kailey Stauble** - The bug safari extraordinaire. Write the majority of Phase 1 report and confirm phase 1 changes made to Github.  
* **Ceasar Salas** - The code crunching garden gnome. Moved Phase 1 report from Google Doc to markdown file format on Github and made relevant changes to main ReadMe.

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

We used two methods to aquire data on our problem.  
* Online survey of Bash and command line users (n=25) to get qualitative data on experiences.
* Study of documentation was used to understand the relevent content and current solutions to the problem.<br>  

The data that was aquired in summary:
* There is formal evalution of the documentation study. 
  * Hard to read
  * Not visually appealing 
* Survey responses:
  * 80% have some or large amounts of existing knowledge on Bash
  * 76% agreed that they would like to learn more about Bash
  * 88% would like to know how write Bash scripts
  * 40% search blindly on the internet for Bash solutions
  * Only 32% have go-to websites they visit for Bash solutions
  * 91.7% noted that they prefer [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) for information on Bash<br>

From the data points above, we have found that a large majority would make use of a new method or website to learn Bash concepts. Responders appear to have a hard time with Bash and would be widely receptive to more intuitive process of learning Bash and troubleshooting it.
