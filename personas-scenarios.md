# VariedLearning Team's Bash_It - Meet the Simulacra

***

# Personas

## Lola

A sophomore computer science student in college who is learning to script for the first time and is looking for a variety of tools to assist her in learning the basics of Bash and terminal in general.

## Charlie

A person who is working full time at a company and utilizes scripts on a daily basis but needs to brush up on the particular usage of a certain command. He has graduated college with a bachelor's in computer science and has been in industry for over five years now. 

## Enzo

A graduate student seeking their masterâ€™s degree in computer science who is already knowledgeable on Bash and the basics but needs to continue learning specific topics and complexities of the language as he works towards his degree. His focus is not in scripting, but he does enjoy the ability to automate as a result of Bash. His time in undergrad helped him gain a lot of knowledge when it comes to bash and scripting. As he is a full time graduate student, he now actively helps contribute in his professor's research projects to get some more expierence. Having seen what his professors have done, he now works on his own projects in his down time. If his projects at least work as a prototype then he can confidently add them to his resume when his later graduates.

# Scenarios

## Lola's trouble with her first scripting assignment

Lola has been given her first assignment in her "Introduction to Scripting" class and has never written a script beyond the scope of a makefile. The assignment is due in a few days and she would like to complete it early with time to spare so that she can properly learn the content. If possible, she would also like to get a handle on the complex use of the more basic commands so that she is prepared for future classes and assignments. Lola especially enjoys watching videos about the content she is learning because she likes to listen to the explanations while seeing her own material in front of her. She would also like a comprehensive list of beginner commands that she can work on memorizing in addition to the videos. After seeing her professors use odd scripts and commands in class, she has only become more interested in the idea of doing something beyond a makefile for the first time. She is excited to practice the commands that she learns; however, she isn't sure where to start. She has been told repeatedly to make use of man pages by professors, but they are very complex. StackOverflow by contrast, which is the recommnedation of other students, doesn't help asnwer her questions very well and even makes her more confused at times since some forum responces contridict what her professors have said in class. 

## Charlie's goal to streamline without being a bother

Charlie uses scripts in his daily work to speed up his workflow although he still finds himself having to complete some repetitive tasks that he doesn't know how to automate. When Charlie doesn't know how to do something, his first instict is to look up his problem online. Sometimes the results he gets are either too broad or not specific enough to answer his particular question, to which leads him to sometimes ask his coworkers for help with said questions. A lot of the time, Charlie finds that only the more basic questions regarding bash and scripting are answered in depth online, while the more advanced material is rarely asked about in the same amount of detail. If possible, Charlie would like to be able to find answers to his more advanced scripting questions online and not have to bother his coworkers. 

## Enzo's somewhat overfilled plate

Enzo is in the porcess of trying to manage a few different projects as he works on his master's. Between his professor's research projects, his own assignments, and personal projects to add to his resume later, Enzo has a lot on his plate. In order to better manage all of these documents, he has decided on using Bash as a scripting langauge to automate his tasks to some degree. His time in undergrad was some help in this field as he knew some things from memory but was still finding that he needed the internet a lot. His ultimate goal is to get a little more time for himself as a result of creating some scripts, namely in the vein of testing and debugging wherever he can.
