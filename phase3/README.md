## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation


***

### Executive Summary

Our [Bash_It Protocol](./Bash_It Usability Protocol.pdf) follows the standard introduction, background, tasks, wrap-up format. 
The protocol should be used in conjunction with the linked [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FIqq6j3p5KgUfBvEwHWqkdQP7pWZI4gLfAT9lYCWlLQ/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for detailed note taking. 
Protocol by the numbers:
* There are **4 background** questions
* There are **4 tasks** to complete 
   * Each task has **3 to 5** objectives to complete
   * Each task is **followed by a satisfaction** question concerning the task's difficulty
* There are **7 wrap up** questions to review the protocol
* The usability test should **take 30 to 45 minutes**
Within this report are all concerning links as well as a description of why we have each question or task. 
The Usability test should make use of the [Adobe XD Wireframe Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c58e83a1-0a07-43b8-a67d-16913158bbbc-90dd/) for use by the participant in their completion of their tasks.

### Our Usability Protocol

##### Protocol PDF contained on Github:

[Bash_It Protocol](./Bash_It Usability Protocol.pdf) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol is originally written on Google Docs and is an internal document. The protocol's format and design was inspired by a short [Zillow Evaluation Protocol](./Protocol-Zillow-2019.pdf) sheet.

##### Google Sheets link for Data Note-taking

[Google Sheets Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FIqq6j3p5KgUfBvEwHWqkdQP7pWZI4gLfAT9lYCWlLQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The google sheets makes use of the fact that there can be multiple sheets within a single document. There is a seperate sheet for each section and task. This allows for easy expansion of catagories and seperation of data for clearity. 

##### Adobe XD Wireframe-based Prototype 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From phase 2 report, there have been minor changes to simulate increased functionality for a user. Namely, it is in the form of adding to the actions a user can take when they interact with the scripting interactive feature.

##### Protocol Desctiption and Formating

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our protocol should be printed out for hand-writing notes by the proctor and used in conjunction with the google sheets (linked above) for more precise note-taking for any additional note takers. As of writing this phase 3 report, this protocol should be used in conjunction with the latest Adobe XD wireframe prototype. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protocol follows the standard format of introduction, background questions, some scenario-focused usability tasks, and lastly set of concluding questions. More specifically, we ask 4 background questions with some nuance. There are four tasks, where each task has
three to five basic objectives for the participant to complete. Each task is followed by a satisfaction question that queries the difficulty of the task. Lastly, there are 7 listed questions for the wrap-up section 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We predict the whole procedure, not including the informed consent and related questions, will take about thirty to forty-five minutes.

### Our Usability Protocol Explanation and Reasoning

#### Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction informs the user of what the usability test will entail and asks if there are any general questions before the test begins.

#### Background

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background questions are intended to get an idea of the experiences that the user has with coding before the usability test. These questions will help us determine how more or less experienced users may feel about the site and allow us to ensure we are catering to all knowledge levels.

##### Question 1:* Do you know how to code? *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is seeking baseline knowledge for coding in general. If the user does know how to code, we will gather information such as the languages they know as well as where they learned how to code, whether that is in the classroom or online. 

##### Question 2:* Are you familiar with Bash?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is more specific to the website itself and gives us an idea of how familiar the user may be with Bash specifically before interacting with our platform intended to teach users Bash. This information may explain how the user interacts with the site or how their experience may differ based on their familiarity with Bash. 

##### Question 3: *Have you used websites to answer questions regarding your code?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is intended to discover whether the user is familiar with using the internet and websites to answer questions regarding code. This is another way to gauge previous knowledge but also is more specific to how the user will interact with our particular website.

##### Question 4: *Have you used any websites to learn how to code?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final background question is specific to users who may have used the internet to learn how to code which would give them an advantage when it comes to navigating the website. These users may find the site to be more or less efficient than other sites they have used and may provide valuable feedback.

#### Tasks

##### Task 1: *<testing: Usage w/o Login>*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first task aims to discover how a user interacts with the website without being logged in as a user. Many of the site users may be looking for quick answers to problems they may have or to quickly learn a command that can streamline their work. Because of this, many users will not be logged in but may still access some parts of the site. This task t will hopefully reveal the ability of a user to achieve their goals on the site without creating an account and logging in first. There are a number of things that we are checking for while the user completes this task such as their ability to navigate to certain pages on the site. We are also interested in the difficulty level of navigation as well as any issues the user may have had, especially due to the fact that they are not logged in.

##### Task 2: *<testing: login>*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second task is testing the login aspect of the site. We want to ensure that signing up to use the platform and creating a public profile are easy enough tasks for the user to encourage users to continue to return to the site. This task checks to make sure that the user is able to create a new account, add their information, and upload a profile picture. We are also interested in the ease of use of the site in terms of creating a new account and what could possibly be improved upon in terms of efficiency. 

##### Task 3: *<testing: practice scripting>*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third task targets the practice page of our site to make sure that the user is able to both use this feature as well as enjoy and learn from it. This task seeks to reveal if users are easily able to discover this practice page as well as get some hands-on experience with the command that they want to learn more about.

##### Task 4:* <testing: using the forum>*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth task is testing how a user would interact with the forums page of the site. There are a few main features to the forums page including navigating to the page itself, searching for certain topics or questions, and posting a question to the forum. We are curious to know if these features are easy enough for a user to learn while using the site and whether or not the user found the forum page layout simple enough to navigate. 

#### Wrap Up

##### Question 1: *Overall, what did you like most about the site? *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question will help us determine what was done well in designing the site and should be kept. 

##### Question 2: *What did you dislike the most about the site? *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question will give us insight as to what the user may have disliked about the site and more importantly why they disliked it so that we can go back and alter the site to be more appealing to users. 

##### Question 3: *How did you feel about the layout and look of the site?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question will ensure that our site is not only helpful to users but is also pleasant to look at as well as straightforward enough to navigate. Using the platform should be a good experience for users and should help them with their questions without requiring them to take the time to learn how the site works (learnability). 

##### Question 4: *On a scale from 1-5, where 1 is "Very Difficult" and 5 is "Very Easy" how would you rate being able to use this website? Why?*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question gauges the difficulty that the user experienced while navigating the website. This will tell us what needs to be changed in order to make the experience more fluid and simpler for users as well as give us details as to what users may have found easy to use about the site so we can implement similar features. 

##### Question 5: *Are there any additional features you would like for it to have? *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question allows us insight as to what users may be looking for in a website that helps them learn Bash; any features that they come up with while navigating the site would likely be beneficial to add in order to assist each user in achieving their goals. 

##### Question 6: *Now, I’d like to look back at certain parts of the search tool and get your thoughts on them:.*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question ascertains the user’s thoughts on the search feature of the site and ensures that users are getting the results they are looking for and that it is a satisfying experience for them.

##### Question 7 : *Any other thoughts or comments? *
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question is looking for any feedback or comments from the user that the previous questions may not have addressed. This is particularly useful as users may have insights to the site that we did not consider as its creators. 

#### Overall Approach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach that we took with this protocol was a think-aloud approach to gauge what the user is thinking as they complete the tasks that we gave them. This gives us an idea of the step-by-step process that goes through a user’s head while they interact with the site and may point out some valuable information about the way that users perceive and interact with the site. For our tasks, we made sure to target the more specialized aspects of the site such as the practice page and the forums page. These more complicated interactions allow us to make determinations about them to make them as simple as possible for users so they have a pleasant experience.
